      {
        "question": "What does 'Recruiting' mean for a clinical trial on ClinicalTrials.gov?",
        "answer": "The trial is currently enrolling eligible participants."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between 'Not Yet Recruiting' and 'Recruiting'?",
        "answer": "'Not Yet Recruiting' means the trial plans to enroll participants soon but has not started yet; 'Recruiting' means enrollment has begun."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does 'Active, not recruiting' mean?",
        "answer": "Participants are still in the trial, but enrollment is closed."

    "section": "Study Type and Intervention Questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What is an 'Interventional' clinical trial?",
        "answer": "Participants are prospectively assigned to receive one or more specific interventions (e.g., drugs, devices, procedures) to evaluate their effects on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is an 'Observational' study different from an interventional trial?",
        "answer": "No intervention is assigned; researchers observe participants and measure outcomes without altering treatment or environment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are 'Patient Registries'?",
        "answer": "Organized systems that collect uniform data on patients with a specific condition or treatment over time, primarily for observational and long-term follow-up purposes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are 'Expanded Access' studies?",
        "answer": "Programs that allow patients to access investigational drugs or treatments outside of clinical trials when no comparable alternatives exist."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the 'Individual Patient' expanded access?",
        "answer": "A form of expanded access where investigational treatment is provided to a single patient under compassionate use protocols, often for serious or life-threatening conditions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the 'Intermediate-size Population' expanded access?",
        "answer": "Expanded access for a group of patients larger than a single patient but smaller than a widespread treatment population, often used when some clinical data exist but formal approval is pending."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is 'Treatment IND/Protocol' expanded access?",
        "answer": "A broader expanded access program under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application or protocol that allows treatment use of an investigational product for a larger patient group outside clinical trials."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of interventions are common in interventional trials?",
        "answer": "Drugs, biologics, medical devices, procedures (including surgery), behavioral or dietary interventions, radiation therapy, or strategies to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kinds of outcomes are measured in interventional vs. observational studies?",
        "answer": "Interventional trials measure effects of assigned interventions on health outcomes; observational studies measure associations or natural progression without intervention."

      {
        "question": "How does trial phase affect eligibility or trial purpose?",
        "answer": "Earlier phases have stricter safety criteria; later phases focus on broader populations and final validation."
